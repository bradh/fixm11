                The AbstractFeature type is the parent of all FIXM complex types that describe physical
                objects or events.

                It is used as a marker to messaging and other tools that the contained information is
                to be treated as an unit and not further decomposed.

                AbstractFeature carries information about the ultimate source of its contained data
                in the "Provenance" attribute group. Implicitly, this information qualifies all the
                contained elements, unless one of them overrides it locally.

                Since AbstractFeature contains the "anyAttr" attribute, it is legal to decorate an
                AbstractFeatureType with any attribute required by an application, so long as the
                attribute name is qualified by the appropriate name space and the name is unique among all
                applications. It is expected that applications will use this to record their own meta-data
                about the information contained in the feature.

                 ProvenanceAttr carries three attributes that describe the ultimate source of
                 the data that it modifies:
                 system              The name of the system that generated the data contained in the Provenance.
                 center              The ATC center (or FIR) that produced the data contained in the Provenance.
                 source              The source of the data in the message (unstructured, for archival analysis).
